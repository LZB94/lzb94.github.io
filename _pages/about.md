👨🏻‍💻 I'm a Postdoc Researcher at the University of Gothenburg, collaborate with [Prof. Deliang Chen](https://www.dess.tsinghua.edu.cn/sz/ys.htm) and [Dr. Céline Heuzé](https://cheuze.com/). I have a PhD degree in Physical Oceanography at Peking University, supervised by [Prof. Yongyun Hu](https://faculty.pku.edu.cn/yyhu/).   

🔬 My research interests include present and future climate (near-surface wind speed, atmospheric hydorlogical cycle, atmospheric teleconnection), as well as paleoclimate (deep-time, last millennium).

📽️ International cooperation is always welcomed!
